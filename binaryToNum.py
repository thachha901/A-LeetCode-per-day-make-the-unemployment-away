# # Definition for singly-linked list.
# Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

# Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

# The most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.
